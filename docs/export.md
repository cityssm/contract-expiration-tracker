## Exporting Results

![Export Options](images/exportOptions.png)

Below the search results, there are export options.
**Note that the search filters apply to the exports.**

There are two export formats available.

-   **CSV** of comma-separated values is a table format.
    It works with many spreadsheet applications, like Microsoft Excel,
    and all text editors.

-   **iCal** is a calendar format.
    It is compatible with applications like Microsoft Outlook.

When exporting, you have two options.

-   Click the button,
    and download the current search results.
    Once downloaded, the search results in the file are static,
    and will not update with any changes made in the system.

-   Right-click the button,
    and copy the link for use in your application of choice.
    The application can use that link to retrieve a current copy
    of the search results.
